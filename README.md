This is the backend for my app, Culinairy. It currently has one basic endpoint to generate recipes, utilizing Open AI's API. In order to run the app, you'll need to add your own Open AI API key in the .env file.

The frontend repository for Culinairy can be found here: https://github.com/asch89/Culinairy-App
